Creates a web server that :
- displays the status of the local wifi Access Point on a raspberry server,
- displays the list of MAC addresses connected onto the Access Point,
- enables to start / stop the Access Point remotely (actually start / stops hostapd service on the server).

Example :
- "raspeberrypi.local" (Raspberry server) with "rpiAP" Access Point operated on the server (pwd BELLATCHIC).
- http://raspberry.local:3000 (main page for web server) displays the status of the AP with the list of connected devices (if any). The Start / Stop button (depending on current status) enables to start / stop the AP.


Acces Point configured with hostapd (/etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf) service.
Requires /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf file with options as follow to run the "hostapd_cli all-sta" command :
- ctrl_interface=/var/run/hostapd
- ctrl_interface_group=0

Web server functionality is independent of the AP SSID and password.

To install, copy all files, run "npm install" to install node dependencies.
To launch the server, run "npm start".
Can also be sarted as a service (with forever node package) or provisionned as a service (with forever-service node package) : run "sudo forever-service install controlrpiAP".
